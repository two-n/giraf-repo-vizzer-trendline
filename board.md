# Hi!

You are viewing a thing called a **Giraf Board**. It showcases the interactive visualization you see right below, made by [TWO-N](http://www.two-n.com). Boards provide information and tools for sharing their content on the web.

# What can you do with this?

## Embed it on *your* page

If you're writing HTML or have a blog that allows including a `<script>` tag in a post, you could embed this interactive visualization as is, right on your page. Just add the following code to the page you're creating:

    <script src="https://giraf.herokuapp.com/static/vizzer/embed.js#url=https://giraf.herokuapp.com/~/two-n/giraf-repo-vizzer-trendline/master/index.json"></script>

[Here's an example](http://blog.two-n.com/posts/giraf-embed) of embedding working on a TWO-N blog post. It's possible that the blog service you use doesn't allow embedding `<script>` tags. In that case, you can still...

## Link to the standalone version

[The standalone version of this visualization](/~/two-n/giraf-repo-vizzer-trendline/master/index.html) is a clean page with just the interactive visualization in it. Its URL is:

    https://giraf.herokuapp.com/~/two-n/giraf-repo-vizzer-trendline/master/index.html

You could link to that URL above, or copy+paste the snippet below into your page to create and HTML Anchor tag linking to the standalone version:

    <a href='https://giraf.herokuapp.com/~/two-n/giraf-repo-vizzer-trendline/master/index.html'>Link to example visualization</a>

## Share a static image

You could also embed an image of this visualization on your page and use it as the **call to action** that, when clicked, will take users to the standalone version.
